# My Personal Jungle Garden: An App for Plant Lovers

<img width="1259" alt="plant_info" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/53062479/86591294-4d6cdd80-bf5f-11ea-8983-0b59e322f712.png">

My Personal Jungle Garden is an app that allows users to keep logs of their plant journey. I came up with this idea because I wanted to record my planting and gardening experiences. As a relatively new plant mom, I am still experimenting with understanding which types of plants are suitable for the different areas in my current living space. Plant lovers and gardeners would benefit from this app as it tracks their plant growing history, which could help them with future plant growths.

## Planning Story

Since this was a full-stack app, I first approached this app by writing user stories and creating wireframes. Then, I set each user story and component of the wireframe as a small goal.

Once I had my plan clearly laid out, I began to work on the back end API, which you can view here (https://github.com/huangc909/my-personal-jungle-garden).

Afterwards I worked on the front end client side of the application. I created the pages for the following features:
- sign-in
- sign-up
- change password
- view plant collections
- add plant collection
- edit plant collection
- view a specific plant collection with the plants in that collection
- add plants to a specific plant collection
- update plant information

Through working on this app, I found that it gave me the opportunity to practice and understand better how to store and use stored data. It was an interesting challenge to figure out how to get the data that I needed for a particular AJAX request to the API even when a form did not provide a specific data.


## User Stories

- As a user, I want to be able to sign up for a user account.
- As a user, I want to be able to sign in to my user account.
- As a user, I want to be able to change my password for my account.
- As a user, I want to be able to sign out of my user account.
- As a user, I want to be able to add my plants to my account.
- As a user, I want to be able to see all of the plants that I have added to my collection.
- As a user, I want to be able to record information about my plants (the name, nickname, date acquired, additional notes, and logs)
- As a user, I want to be able to edit my plant information.
- As a user, I want to be able to delete my plant information.


## Technologies Used:

- JavaScript
- jQuery
- cURL
- API
- JSON
- HTML
- CSS
- Sass
- Bootstrap
- Handlebars

### Unsolved Problems
I would like to eventually:
- Fix the update request for plants: While the update plant page is visible, I am currently working on getting the update request to go through.
- Add another sub document feature that includes logs for users to keep track of their plant care journey.
- Stylizing the page to fit smaller screens and to adhere to my wireframes set up.
